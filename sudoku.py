# def print_board(sudoku):
# This prints the board out in 3x3 grids with lines in between each 3x3 for 1 sudoku column.
#
# def complete_failed():
# This just compares the solved sudoku with the right sudoku values. If it is equal to the solved
# table then you have won. If not, you've lost. Here it will also display the total amount of turns and how long it told
# you to solve it. It will also ask if you want to play again or just quit sudoku.
#
# def computer_play():
# This is just a solver for the computer to do.
# So, it goes through each row and looks for an empty slot. When it finds an empty slot it will fill it with numbers
# from 1 to 9.
# It will then check each row, column and the number to see if it is the same. If it is it will slowly remove those
# numbers and match them with it. It will them check the individual 3x3 grid to see if the numbers are the same.
# if they are then it'll change the numbers accordingly to each row.
# There is then a checker to see for more blank spaces. If there are not any it will loop back to the top and start
# again. However, if there aren't any it will take you to the complete_failed function. This will check against the
# the solved table and determine if the computer wins.
#
# def human_play():
# This is just a function that takes your inputs on [row] and [col] and aligns them with the table.
# Then there is also a 'num' which is the number that is inputted into the sudoku table.
# Then there is the withdraw mode. This just gets an inputted number for the row and column you want to remove from
# and removes the column at that point.
# Help mode is used when the user presses h. In help mode it will look for blank spaces and suggest what moves can be
# made. So, if you typed h you'd get a result back such as at (0,0) input number 6. This is done for each place you type
# row and col from. It isn't intergrated well and is very messy.
#
# def human_is_valid():
# This function is purely used just to see if the space you're wanting to input a number is free. If it isn't free
# it will print a message telling you that and asking for another valid input.
#
# def choose_board():
# This just asks for what board the player wants to use. So, if the person inputted 4 it will use the sudoku board
# sudoku4. If you input an invalid number such as 5 it will tell you it's an invalid choice and ask for you to choose
# again. If you input a valid one it will load up play_choose.
#
# def play_choose():
# This function is purely used to pick who you want to play. If you want the computer to play you'll just have to type
# in computer and the same works if you type human for human play. If you type an invalid player it will ask for
# another input.
# Human input will load = human_play, human_is_valid
# Computer input will load computer_play
